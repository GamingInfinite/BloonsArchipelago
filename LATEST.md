# Bug Fixes
I figure I'll leave the blurb from the first release about modding and stuff so long as I don't have a proper setup guide.

Anyways we've got a couple of new developments
- We've got a Medal "tracker" of sorts on the main menu now.  You no longer have to look at the mod console to see medals.
- The Maps no longer all show as being locked except for the Goal Map.  Still planning on adding a separate icon to indicate it, but its more clear now.
- Leveling has been fixed so that if in a round you get more than 1000xp then it properly handles the xp.
- If you tested the game before and noticed that your map difficulty filter didn't work, should be fixed now so go download the new update of the [apworld](https://github.com/GamingInfinite/Archipelago/releases).

## Standard Stuff
1. This mod requires ModHelper.  It's linked on the main ReadMe so go download it.  All the setup on how to install it and this mod are on there.
2. PLEASE put any bugs you encounter as an issue on github or ping me on discord.
3. PLEASE backup your savefile when using mods.  With bloons it shouldn't be that much of an issue, but just in case please please please backup your save file

Your savefile can be found in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<YourSteamUserID>\960090".  Back it up, it shouldn't be in danger but with modding, especially one this fresh (more specifically coded by me), you never know.
