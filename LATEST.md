# Bloons AP v(0.3.1/0.2.0) (Mod/APWorld)
Knowledge Randomization is here!  There were also adjustments made such as Monkey Knowledge filler check getting replaced, as well as adding a proper location for Map Unlocks (that wasn't a thing before bc im dumb), but Knowledge is the main thing.

Notes:
- Knowledge Checks are pretty stable, but I don't know how it interacts with, say, double clicking on a knowledge you already have, but is changed to available by the mod.  Any and all crashes/errors should get reported here right away, but for now just hit the check button in the bottom right if a knowledge button is glowing
