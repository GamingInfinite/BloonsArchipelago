- Monkey Randomization

Thats literally it this update.  I'd do more but this is a significant *breaking* change in the code as the new standard will be playing with monkey and map randomization.
Please finish any games that you have going on currently before updating your client.

For setup information please check the Readme.  If it isn't there yet I haven't bothered, and I'll get to it eventually.  Just ask me in the discord about setup stuff its early morning and I'm tired.
