# First Release
I'm super excited for y'all to play this but there are a couple things before you get started.

1. This mod requires ModHelper.  It's linked on the main ReadMe so go download it.  All the setup on how to install it and this mod are on there.
2. Second, this mod has NOT been tested at all outside of the individual features.  PLEASE put any bugs you encounter as an issue on github or ping me on discord.
3. PLEASE backup your savefile when using mods.  With bloons it shouldn't be that much of an issue, but just in case please please please backup your save file

Your savefile can be found in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\<YourSteamUserID>\960090".  Back it up, it shouldn't be in danger but with modding, especially one this fresh (more specifically coded by me), you never know.
